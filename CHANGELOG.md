1. GlobalFilters utils:

  - set allowClear on array type fields
  - set maxTagCount: 'responsive' on fields with enum
  - hide filters' fields labels when displayed inline
  - fixed normalizing read filters when field type is array
2. Dynamic Fields building:
  - componentBuilders: support array types with integer items
3. Form/Field/index:
  - support item.fieldCol config

v1.73.0
[feat] Draggable tree select

v1.72.0
[feat] Introduced custom, more tailored screen breakpoints.

Default breakpoints provided by Antd do not suit our projects too well because they do not differentiate different desktop sizes too well. New breakpoints allow to differentiate between different desktop/laptop screens sizes allowing for more tailored rules.

Previously: Screens with width between 1200 and 1600 were all treated as XL screen. And screens above 1600 were treated as XXL.
Now:
 - Screens with width 1280 and below are treated as MD
 - Screens with width 1440 and below are treated as LG
 - Screens with width 1800 and below are treated as XL
 - Screens with width above 1800 are treated as XXL.


v1.71.0
[feat] Make sideMenu collapsible and auto-collapse on screens smaller than xxl.

This provides more screen real estate for users using smaller screens.

v1.70.0
[feat&refactor&fix]
- refactor TopNav component to add dynamic components
- refactor CompanyLogo component for dynamic placement in header
- export Breadcrumb component
- restored cropped logo with transparent background
- show SideBar if items are present
- passed content container styles
- fix TopNav propTypes

v1.69.7
[fix] getFormErrors - parse error key to int if possible.

Otherwise antd's Form is not able to set the errors correctly using setFields.

v1.69.6
[feat] Export store.triggerGlobalAlert

v1.69.5
[fix] Dynamic Fields building - do not modify type value when is array.

array.pop() modifies the array.

v1.69.4
[fix] Component Field label not displayed.

This fixes a bug, where passed component label (ie <strong>{field-one}</strong>) was ignored.

Additionally, fixed Popover prop types.

v1.69.3
[fix] Active icon color

v1.69.2
[fix] Decode uri component for link ActionButton

Will support received action's href option including encoded uri (ie new?id=%3Aid)

v1.69.1
[fix]
1. Side menu item colors
2. Client select color

v1.69.0
[feat] Components improvements and additions

1. Added Flex, Steps and Timeline from antd
2. StageUI now exports LoadingBlock component
3. LoadingBlock now accepts tip property.
4. Fixes Popover's propTypes
5. ProDescriptions now pass remaining props to antd's Description
6. Tag now accepts size prop, which allows to display tags of different sizes (large and default supported atm)
7. TagsList now accepts tagSize prop, which is passed to Tag

v1.68.0
[feat] Extended date utils functionality

1. timeBetween now accepts relative param, which when true, uses i18n to appropriate wording
2. formatDuration now uses i18n to find the conjuction param value
3. formatDuration now passes language and fallback languages to humanizeDuration

v1.67.0
[feat] Extended dynamic fields functionality

1. Set showSearch=true as default for Select when field type is string
2. Pass the 'hint' property from json schema to field.item
3. Added 'whitespace: true' rule when field type is 'string' and 'minLength' property exists

v1.66.0
[feat] SmartList and SmartTable now accept and display extraDataDisplay prop.

v1.65.0
1. Added RadioGroup component
2. Added ability to pass extra children to SideMenu

v1.64.0
[feat] Preserve column.render for table columns using ActionButtons

v1.63.1
[fix] Fixed SmartTable ignoring pagination parameter and assigning default pagination value, which forced pagination to appear in every table

v1.63.0
[feat] Dynamic fields - normalize empty string value in field to undefined.

APIs usually differently interpret missing key than an empty value. This has proven to be the case in Blueprints.

Additionally:
 - do not pass fixParentNode to Autocomplete component.

v1.62.0
[feat] Support displaying GlobalFilters in a modal.

Received globalFilterOptions can now specify whether a filter input should be displayed inline (default) or in a modal.

It supports both boolean value as well as array of breakpoints.

Example configurations:

1. `{ filter_one: { modal: true }, filter_two: { inline: true } }`
2. `{ filter_one: { modal: false }, filter_two: { inline: false } }` - will show filter_one inline and filter_two in a modal
3. `{ filter_one: { modal: ['xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl'] }, filter_two: { inline: ['xxl'] } }` - will show both filters in modal on screens smaller than xxl, otherwise they will be inline

Additionally, if all filters are set to be displayed in modal then no inline form will be visible and the filters are submitted on the modal. When filters are set to be displayed in modal, then the "Filter" button will not show up.

The change is backwards compatible - inline is a default placement.

v1.61.2
[feature] Exported SmartDataDisplay component

v1.61.1
[fix] hide broken links if currentSystem is undefined

v1.61.0
[feat&fix] Support order field in GlobalFilters + fixes.

Adds support for Order/Sorting in dynamically built GlobalFilters.

Fixes & Improvements:
  - Do not mount GlobalFilters until filters schema properties are available
  - Do not set default placeholder for GlobalFilter fields, but be able to read it from translations
  - Reworked applySorter util - it now expects a string with sortable column and direction
  - Adjusted how filters, pagination and sorter are applied in SmartTable
  - Do not apply filters nor sorter when paginating
  - Reset pagination to page 1 when filtering and/or sorting


v1.60.1
[fix] Allowed to add a different color for ClientsDropdown in TopNav

v1.60.0
[feat] Added new component CompanyLogo

v1.59.1
[feat] Improved Tabs styling.

- Moved inline styles to styled-components
- isHorizontal prop is now deprecated, the flag is calculated based on tabPosition prop ('top' being default)

Additionally:
- PageContainer will not mount h4 when title is not present

v1.59.0
[feat] Build GlobalFilters using json_schema.filters

This decouples the GlobalFilters' filtering set up from SmartTable and allows to build the filters using json_schema.

Additionally:
  - Moved filtering utils needed only for SmartTable to SmartTable utils.

v1.58.0
[refactor] DataView - Store json_schema.filters.properties as filtersSchema instead of filters.

1. This is a preparation for GlobalFilters refactor into building them using json_schema.
2. The pre-existing buildFilters is preserved, but moved to filtering utilities. It is still in use for GlobalFilters and SmartTable.
3. These changes improve json_schema handling in buildFilters utility:
  - it is now able to read valueEnum and/or enum from definition where type is array and it contains items
  - it now adds true and false where type is boolean
4. Improvements described in 3. might be BREAKING if json_schema provided was previously changed in order to support array and boolean types.

v1.57.1
[feat] Dynamic form building - allow to extend item's component with custom props.

Additionally:
 - fix import issue in Form component, which could cause circular dependency

v1.57.0
[feat] Introduced dynamic form fields building utilities.

Moved from BlueprintsUI where it is used to build outputs fields.

v1.56.0
[feat] Added SmartDataDisplay and SmartList

SmartDataDisplay is essentially a wrapper for SmartTable and SmartList that takes some of the filtering, sorting and paginating handling from DataView and SmartTable.

It provides a single place that is responsible for applying the URL search and allows to de-duplicate the code.

Potentially breaking:
Due to this, exporting SmartTable as a component no longer makes sense.

v1.55.7
[fix] Ensure pagination is correctly disabled in Table and List

Bug introduced in v1.55.4

v1.55.6
[fix] Improve margins for horizontal tabs list in PageContainer.

v1.55.5
[feat] Moved GlobalFilters out of SmartTable

Additionally:
- added default Input component to GlobalFilters


v1.55.4
[chore] Moved pagination normalisation to the components that actually need it.

The normalisation/translation is needed because our pagination object contains total_items and per_page keys while antd's components (Table and List) need total and pageSize respectively.

There is no real need to do the normalisation in DataView nor in SmartTable, hence it was moved to the "end of the chain".

v1.55.3
[feat] Allow to use DataView w/o PageContainer

DataView might be useful as a nested component.
Passing "pageHeader = false" will not mount PageContainer.

v1.55.2
[feat] feat: Added Typography.UpperCaseText

v1.55.1
[feat] feat: Add translations support to List

v1.55.0
[feat] Introduced DataView as a replacement for TableView.

This allows to use all the utilities needed to load and filter the data w/o limiting it to a Table.

v1.54.0
[feat] Add Score component.

v1.53.1
[fix] Fixed side menu and breadcrumbs

v1.53.0
[feat] Made AutoComplete smarter.

It can now accept enums and/or valueEnum and convert them into options (similar behaviour to Select).
Using AutoComplete instead Select allows users to input their own value as well as select one from the dropdown.

v1.52.3
fix: ProDescription component key error: updated component according to antd Descriptions documentation

v1.52.2
[chore] Added missing tests for MarkdownEditor utilities.

They were skipped in https://github.com/forward3d/stage_ui/pull/179

v1.52.1
- fix style provider for nextjs

v1.52.0
[feat] Added Cascader and extended object utils

1. Cascader - https://ant.design/components/cascader
2. object utils
  - pick
  - omit

v1.51.1
[Table] - Do not force translate column.title

v1.51.0
- add styleProvider

v1.49.5
fix: store dependencies in the TableView hook

v1.49.4
fix: Make usePusherNotify use final received initial value.

It was set to use the first received initial value, however when used deep down the components tree, that value was not always the correct one. Replicated behaviour of usePusherCreateItem and usePusherEditItem

v1.49.3
[fix] Disabled forwardRef support for withScopedTranslations HOC due to failed CI

v1.49.2
Added support for forwardRef wrapped components to withScopedTranslations HOC

v1.49.1
fix: Moved 'ExtendedCard = withLoader(AntdCard' out of Card component

Such things should never be in the component function, it can get updated and it gets reset.

v1.49.0
fix [antd: message]
- Updated message component
- Used App component
- added useTableViewSetup hoc

v1.48.0
feat: Make FieldsList accept onAdd dynamic fields handler and export Modal.useModal

v1.47.0
feat: Added array and object utilities + make all Card(s) use withLoader HOC.

1. array utilities
  - groupItemsBy => takes the array of objects and key by which it should group the data as arguments,
    returns an object of grouped items
  - insert => takes the array, item to insert and position at which the item should be inserted,
    returns modified array
2. object utilities
  - isObject => checks if value is an object with properties (ie { test: true })
3. Card component
  - extended it with withLoader hook => this way the Card.Table does not require it and all Cards have the same loader

v1.46.0
fix [antd: message] Static function can not consume context like dynamic theme. Used 'App' component instead.

v1.45.0
feat: Forms improvements

1. allow to pass fields as a function for FieldsList dynamic={true}
2. Make Select not display the dropdown when mode is 'tags' and there are no enums nor valueEnums - it appears as Tag Input
3. Added Input.Number.

v1.44.4
[fix] Module level directives warning

v1.44.3
[fix][SC-15] updated antd from ^5.4.2 to ^5.8.3

v1.44.2
[fix][SC-10] [antd: Tooltip] destroyTooltipOnHide no need config keepParent anymore. Used boolean value directly.
[fix][SC-12] [antd: Tooltip] `arrowPointAtCenter` is deprecated, used `arrow` instead.
[fix][SC-14] [antd: Select] `dropdownMatchSelectWidth` is deprecated. Used `popupMatchSelectWidth` instead.

v1.44.1
Use withLoader HOC for Card.Table

In certain edge cases the Table needs to be mounted once the data is loaded. One of such cases is using 'expandable.defaultExpandAllRows' - the rows are not expanded when table is mounted without the data.

v1.44.0
feat: Allow custom column render in ProDescriptions and added Popover component

v1.43.1
fix: Card.Table should use Loading spinner instead of Skeleton for better UI.

v1.43.0
[feature] Added ability to pass actions translate options to page header of the TableView via pageHeader.actionsTranslateOptions property

v1.42.0
[SC-17] Support I18n - Added basic i18n support with nested scoping.

Uses https://react.i18next.com/

1. 1a422b9 added i18n util
2. f289ce6 Allow to configure StageUiApp and reworked loadConfig to make it fetch the translations
3. ae33560 Replaced usage of string.translate with i18n.t for hooks and utils
4. 00d0057 Use useTranslation hook in ProDescription, RequestTable and Tabs
5. 9cc1524 Added missing tests for utils/table/buildColumns.buildColumnTitle
6. 73970f9 Try to find translated field name as label in Field component
7. fa3bf95 Try to read PageContainer title from i18n
8. 39d63c8 Try to read table's column name from i18n or fallback to previous mechanisms.
9. a8e75ad Added PropTypes to touched components

v1.41.2
fix: SmartTable - replaced Table with Card.Table which moves the GlobalFilters form out of the Table title into the Card wrapper.

This prevents unnecessary updates to GlobalFilters when users interact with the table - hover, click etc

v1.41.1
fix: App/loadConfig should ignore null loadConfigParams

v1.41.0
feat: Introduced StageUIApp.

It allows for the UI applications to use the either the StageUiApp component or StageUiApp.provider.

StageUiApp takes over loading of the configuration as well as root-store config storing and management.
This reduces the boiler plate needed to use StageUI in the apps.

v1.40.5
Added withLoader hoc.

It will show a loading screen instead of mounting the component until it is ready.

v1.40.4
fix: ResultsTable's extendColumnsConfig and missing key in Table's row.

v1.40.3
feat: Allow to extend ResultsTable's columns.

The component now accepts an optional 'extendColumnsConfig' function which allows to overwrite columns configuration

v1.40.2
feat: Expose antd's Form hooks via Form component

These hooks make using Forms easier and allow to avoid passing form refs all over the place.

v1.40.1
Added ability to pass apiPlaceholders for setupApiActions TableView utility

v1.40.0
feat: Forms controls improvements

1. Allow to pass controlsProps to Form component
2. Allow to overwrite StepForm step allowSubmit per submitButton

2. PanedCard
  - upgraded Card component which allows to toggle panes
3. TableView

v1.33.2
[fix] Fixed app crush on missing viewActions for TableView

v1.33.1
[feature] SideMenu now properly sets key even if child doesn't include pathname of its parent

v1.33.0
[feature] Added new features and improved SideMenu functionality:
1. Added support for routes, which children have same key as their parent to proper handle expanded and highlighted item
2. Now each item in SideMenu is a Link, so it could be opened in a separate tab and so on
3. Added support for tree-like menu items shape with proper handling of opened and selected items
4. Added possibility to click on a parent, which has children as a separate link and ability to expand its children, clicking on the icon

v1.32.2
Allow Select component to receive fixParentNode prop.

We need to use this functionality when Select is used in modals.
It's easier to just pass a flag instead of repeating the function.

v1.32.1
Improved logic of finding sidebarItems default keys

v1.32.0
[feat] Added default behaviours for handleResponseResult.

1. It will allow the modal to be closable if back-end does not provide any actions - fixes users being stuck with the modal.
2. Will show a default message when an unhandled BE error occurs

v1.31.4
Fixed page crush if Layout sidebarItems doesn't have children property present

v1.31.3
Allow to provide initialValues prop to dynamic fields list.

The `add` operation of Antd's FormList accepts default values for new list item.
Thanks to that, instead of setting initial value per field,
we can pass an object of default values for any new item added to use when new list item is added.

This solves a warning triggered when initialValues are set on Form level:

```
Form already set 'initialValues' with path 'schedules.0.day_of_month'. Field can not overwrite it.
```

Example:
```javascript
<FieldsList dynamic fields={[{ item: { name: 'test' }}]} fieldsInitialValues={{ test: 'initialValue'}} />
```

v1.31.2
[fix] ErrorsList - handle nested error objects

v1.31.1
[fix] Table components fixes

1. Fixed styling of CardTable - the styles were leaking to any nested tables, they should not.
2. Fixed invalid imports in TableView

v1.31.0
[feat] StepForm - allow to have multiple submit buttons.

A submitButtons prop is required for the StepForm to render multiple buttons.
- The submitButtons prop should be an array of objects containing 'display' property.
- It can have all props that Button component accepts
- In order for the buttons to act differently (ie save as draft or save as published), a submitWith prop can be passed.
  This should include a path (antd's Form fieldPath) and value properties - used when called form.setFieldValue before form.submit.


It defaults to a singular, default submit button when this submitButtons prop is not passed.

v1.30.0
[feat] Understand optional action.condition property in ActionButtons.

From now on, the action can have a condition property, which should be a 3 element array:
 - condition[0] must be a name of tested object property (ie `state` for a `template = { state: 'published' }`)
 - condition[1] must be a name of an operator (ie `eql`)
 - condition[2] must be a value to which tested object property is compared (`ie published`)

The condition is evaluated and the ActionButton is displayed only when the result is a truthy value.

Example:
```javascript
const actions = [
  { name: 'deprecate', condition: ['state', 'notEql', 'deprecated'] },
  { name: 'recycle', condition: ['state', 'eql', 'deprecated'] }
]
const recordOne = { state: 'deprecated' }
const recordTwo = { state: 'published' }

// With above actions and records, the 'deprecate' action will be displayed for recordTwo
// and 'recycle' action will be displayed for 'recordOne'
```

v1.29.1
Fix client path replacement in ClientsDropdown

v1.29.0
StageTopNav lives here from now on.

The new TopNav requires following properties to be provided:
 1. `systems` => a list of systems that user has access to, it does not fetch this list anymore (ie `['datasets', 'blueprints']`)
 2. `currentSystem` => name of currently used system (ie `datasets`)

 If the TopNav should display a client select, following additional properties need to be provided:
 1. `clients` => an object with:
   - `available` key, which is a list of client_slugs user has access to
   - `path` key, which is a string including `/:id` parameter, needed
 2. `currentClient` => an object with:
   - `name` key, which is a client_slug
   - `display_name` key, which is client's display name (they differ sometimes)

Also, the ClientsDropdown now has a search input which should prove helpful when user has access to many clients.

v1.28.0
[dep] Bumped chartjs to v4.3.0 which supports tree shaking.

v1.27.3
[feature] Optional Add/Remove actions for the FieldsList component

1.27.2
[feature] Use Space.Compact for SelectWithPrefix and fix reload button border on hover

1.27.1
[feature] Added "X-CSRF-Token" header for non-Get requests

1.27.0
[feature] Added Checkbox component

1.26.1
[fix] Fixed TableView store imports
[feature] Added tests for TableView store

1.26.0
1. Added TableView view
2. Added replacePlaceholder string utility
3. Reused replacePlaceholder utility for ActionButtons with "link" type

1.25.0
[SC-2] Use antd's ConfigProvider and set base theme.

Set it up with base colours and font families for now.

Some components still use ant-design/colors, however they might not be anymore.

1.24.0
Bumped antd to 5.4.2

Fixed breadcrumbs and TagsList not returning anything when no tags.

1.23.1 Export Skeleton component

1.23.0
[feature] Added Input.TextArea component
[feature] Added patch api function
[feature] Replaced Divider with antd component
[fix] Fixed DynamicIcon error if icon name is not passed

1.22.0
[feature] Added Typography component

1.21.7
[fix] Boolean labels in table filters not visible.

Moved the translation of boolean filters' labels to smartTable/filtering.setupFilters function,
which is used for both Table filters and GlobalFilters

1.21.6
Components Improvements

1. ActionButtons
  - support displaying button with icon and iconOnly button
  - support passing component wide size property and apply to any buttons that are not displayed as links
2. Table - allow ant-btn-link to wrap
  - enforce size "small" for ActionButtons buttons that used in rows
3. TagsList - fix key prop and allow to pass Space component props (ie wrap)
4. GlobalFilters - support segmented component

1.21.5
Added Button.Reload

This way it can be reused whenever needed but is still a Button component (no additional export required.)

1.21.4
Allow to forward more props to antd's forms.

Both Form and StepForm were controlling all props received and passed to the antd's Form.
This causes updating the library with any not controlled props, which is an unecessary overhead.

Not controlled props are now passed through to the antd's Form component.

1.21.3
Improved ErrorsList look.

It now has a light gray background and blackish text which makes it more smooth while still clearly being a separate section.

1.21.2
Downgraded zustand to 4.3.0 as it was breaking the build.

Zustand deprecates the default exports and changes from 4.3.0 onwards change how do they determine when to show the deprecation working.

1.21.1
Nested values support for ProDescriptions components (dot notation)

v1.21.0
Added support for WebSockets

1. StageUI can now initialise with WebSocket client (which at the moment is Pusher)
2. Added clients/websocketClient, which replaces utilities/pusher
3. Added hooks/useWebsocket, which currently integrates with usePusher hook
4. Added GlobalAlerts support

The reason for using WebSocket naming instead of pusher and adding the client and useWebsocket hooks is a step towards generalising (decoupling) the functionality from Pusher and allowing for more easier replacement of the WebSocket's client.

v1.20.2
Improved multiselect global filter

v1.20.1
Improved nested errors list render

v1.20.0
Made ErrorsList a separate component and added ResultsTable

v1.19.1
Added ability to change breadcrumb name by passed "buildBreadcrumbNames" parameter function

v1.19.0
Added AutoComplete component

v1.18.1
1. Added TagsList component
2. Added ability to render list of Tags for ProDescriptions component
3. Improved smart table buildColumns utility to pass additional properties to the column if such are passed

v1.18.0
Add multi_select filter

v1.17.1
Improved layout rendering flow
